      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Currently, I am a full time cosmetologist working at a salon in Minneapolis. I am a writer and an adventurer. This page here is the start of a new adventure. One that I am sure will come with many challenges and self-fulfilling moments.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am originally from a small town in west central Illinois. As I like to tell people I'm from the middle of nowhere in-between cows and cornfields.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>There are a lot of hobbies in my life. However, a few of them are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>hiking</li>
        <li>writing</li>
        <li>running</li>
        <li>photography</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be working for a nonprofit that focuses on wildlife and conservation such as the WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature), WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) or the Nature Conservancy.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently I live in Mineapolis. You know, doing that whole country girl in the city thing.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development is a career where a person can use both their analytic and creative skills. I like puzzles and I like being creative. I'm also a master at googling. There was one point where I thought it seemed wasteful not putting my talents to good use. So here I am . . .</p>
